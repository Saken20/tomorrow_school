🧠 PISCINE @ Tomorrow School AI – My Journey
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of tasks, algorithm challenges, and projects completed during the PISCINE at Tomorrow School AI.

🏫 About the Program
The PISCINE is an intensive, immersive bootcamp designed to strengthen programming fundamentals, problem-solving, and system design. The focus is on building deep understanding through hands-on challenges — no hand-holding, just raw coding.

🛠️ What You’ll Find Here
This repo includes:

🧮 Algorithmic problems – classical and advanced algorithm tasks

📂 Shell scripting (.sh) – scripting fundamentals and automation tasks

🌳 Node trees – implementation and manipulation of tree data structures

🧱 Node-based systems – low-level data structure manipulation and logic building

🚀 Projects in Go (Golang) – all tasks were implemented using the Go programming language

Each directory is named according to the task or project it relates to, often containing:

Source code in Go

Problem descriptions

My solutions and notes

Shell scripts used for setup, automation, or testing

💡 Goal of This Repo
This repository is meant to:

Document my learning process and progress

Serve as a resource for others going through similar programs

Demonstrate proficiency in Go, shell scripting, and algorithm design

Feel free to explore the code, fork the repo, or reach out with questions or suggestions!
